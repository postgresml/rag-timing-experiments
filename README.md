# Rag Timing Experiments

This script runs timing tests for common rag systems.

To run it copy `.env.deveopment` to `.env` and make sure to set the appropriate variables in the `.env` file.

Notice that this script assumes certain actions to create databases or setup "collections" have been performed for each cloud provider. See the script for more details.
